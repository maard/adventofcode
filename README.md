# What is this? 

Every December an event called [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is held, where developers from across the world solve programming problems presented in a entertaining manner. A new problem gets published every day of the event.

I try to solve AoC in different programming languages:

1. either this is a new language I want to learn, and I use AoC as a chance to learn that language solving practical problems, or
2. it is the language I have the most fun with at the time of doing AoC.
